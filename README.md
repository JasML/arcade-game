Arcade Game is a basic game modeled after the classic arcade game Frogger. This file describes all steps required to play the game.

GOAL: the goal of this game is to reach the star at the top of the screen without colliding with any enemy bugs.

1. Starting the game. Initialize the game by opening the file index.html in your browser. You will be prompted with an alert stating the overall purpose of the game and pointing you to the bottom of the screen for changing the player icon, if desired. Pressing OK on this alert window will start the game. You'll soon see enemy bugs crossing the screen, and you'll be able to move your avatar around on the screen.

2. Playing the game. Use the arrow keys to move up, down, left, or right to cross the road without colliding with any enemy bugs!

3. If you collide with an enemy bugs, you can replay the game. The player will be moved back to its starting point on the board.

4. If you reach the star, all you get is a window telling you you won (sorry). You can play again, and the player will be moved back to its starting point on the board.

There is currently only one level to the game, and winning doesn't give you anything more than bragging rights at the moment.
