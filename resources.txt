For this project, I used a lot of online resources, including:

- HTML validator (validator.w3.org)
- CSS validator (jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator)
- Udacity style guide (http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/)
- Google (a lot of Google), which often directed me to one of the following:
-- http://www.w3schools.com/css
-- stackoverflow.com
- The sample game provided by Udacity on YouTube
